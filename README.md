# What is Graphe?

> Graphe is a **_fast and minimalistic Bible study application_**, with a focus on using the original language texts (the Hebrew Old Testament, the Septuagint and the Greek New Testament) in conjunction with an English translation. It is currently under active development.

Features include:

- Support for ESV, GNT and LXX
- Instant details while hovering original language
- Minimalistic design with built-in themes

<br/>

# Development & Building

Live development mode: `wails dev`

Build distributable app: `wails build`

Test go code: `go test ./... -v`

Currently requires a large database file that is currently not packaged with the code. However there are plans to make this downloadable.
